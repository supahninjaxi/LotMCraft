# Ability Interactions — Update Design Notes

---

## 1. Universal Systems

### 1.1 Local Time
A mechanic that can be applied to a defined area with a set radius and time-scale value. All time-dependent abilities (projectiles, delayed effects, channelled casts, etc.) that enter or originate within that area check the local time scale and adjust their behaviour accordingly — moving faster, slower, or freezing entirely depending on the value set.

**Key points:**
- Defined by a radius and a time-scale multiplier
- Any ability that "ticks" over time respects the local time scale
- Can be used offensively (slow enemy projectiles) or as a utility zone

---

### 1.2 Mid-Cast Cancellation
Abilities that support interruption will periodically check their surroundings for an entity carrying a specific cancellation tag. If such an entity is detected within proximity, the ability cancels itself cleanly.

**Key points:**
- Cancellation is triggered by a tagged entity spawned near the caster or target
- Abilities opt in to this system — not all abilities are interruptible
- Provides a consistent, extensible hook for any future cancel mechanic

## 2. Pathway Interactions
